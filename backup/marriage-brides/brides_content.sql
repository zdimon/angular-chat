We are here to provide our clients, both male and female, a safe and secure environment to communicate with each other in order to initiate that very special relationship. We use the latest technology to make communication as \"live\" as possible, including providing a venue to communicate via email, Chat, Chat Date and Live Video. <br />Any agency may have problems because of scammers: when a lady comes to register at the agency, all what managers see is her passport (it is obligatory for all our agencies to check lady\'s information: name, age, date of birth, marital status and whether she has children). Further on, when a lady starts writing letters and receives responses from men, the agency (translators and operators) follow ANY requests about money. If we see such a request (exception: covering her travel expenses) - the lady\'s profile is removed from our database.<br /> We are concerned about those women who make asking money from Western men their practice, we are trying to fight the business of scamming men. Be aware that this fraud can be run in the Internet by individuals or agencies. You should know that we are serious agency and understand that only HONEST work will ensure that we stay in the business. We support anti-scam program and warn all Western men - do not send money to Ukrainian women you do not know well, do not mention your income and possessions during correspondence, avoid money topic at all. People in Ukraine think that life in the West is easy and people there have so much money that they do not know what to spend it for. Do not make Ukrainian women think it is true. Our dating agency tries to save you from scammers and give you possibility to meet an honest Ukrainian woman who would become your wife.<br />Use dating agencies where you pay for corresponding and letter forwarding: dating net-works care about their reputation, the agency checks their women-clients identity (so, you avoid possibility to write to a phantom woman), the agency translates and delivers letters to women and do not charge them (so, you avoid possibility to be scammed by need-money-for-internet-cafe-and-translation scenario); besides, you can always ask for advice, help and support.<br />It&rsquo;s impossible for any dating agency to anticipate and prevent all instances of internet dating fraud or web scam. Our site has made significant progress by screening and monitoring all ladies who register on our site.<br />We cooperate with many agencies in Ukraine and CIS nations. We carefully check all users of our site (passport, id).<br />We value our reputation and try to avoid and retrace scammers.

Start showing initiative.</strong><br /> The first impression of the person is deceptive. It is important to get to know the person in order to form the right opinion about them. If you like a woman but your feeling is not mutual it does not mean that she is not interested in you at all. Try to show considerable initiative. Great initiative is considered to be a merit of a man. In most cases a weak, passive and timid man will not be able to awake woman\'s interest. Start your conversations with her on every reason. Russian and Ukrainian brides are very active and rather talkative. They are not only beautiful but also attentive and considerate. They know how to listen and are able to keep up any conversation. Keep active if you want to win the heart of a Russian woman. Remember there are more women than men in such countries as Ukraine, and the number of the former is expected to increase over the next decade. Thus your stand a better chance of success. Know your own mind and start your search. Hundreds of Russian women are waiting for you online.</p>\r\n<p><strong>You can invite a woman to your country.</strong><br /> Women whose profiles are posted on our site are deliberately looking for a man from abroad. There are no obstacles for our ladies to visit your country, yet it depends on their own desires. If a girl trusts you and is willing to visit your country, then you can invite and help her to come to you. Keep it in mind that Ukrainian and Russian girls are brought to be modest and as a result they never ask you out on a date or force their visit upon you. Show initiative and take steps. Send her a photo of your home and your near and dear people. Find out what her relatives think about her visiting a foreign country. Be ready that they can appear hostile to this idea, as in Russia and Ukraine there is a huge TV campaign aimed at warning of the dangers of visiting foreign countries by girls, as there are cases when Slavic girls got into sexual slavery in foreign countries. Thus you have to be honest and understanding. Yet do not afraid of inviting her. You and she may be convinced by our statistics of successful trips abroad, made by our clients.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Spent great time together on a neutral territory.</strong><br /> If your woman hesitates about coming to your country, suggest your meeting on a neutral territory. Russian women like and have the possibility to travel to seaside resorts in different countries. A large number of Ukrainian tourists visit Turkey, Bulgaria, Slovakia, and Hungary. If you have such an opportunity, do not miss the chance to visit a country where your girl-friend is going to travel. This is really a great chance to finally meet in a relaxed and intimate atmosphere, have the most romantic dates one can imagine, spend a great and memorable time together and decide on the further development of your relations. In summer Turkey and Bulgaria welcomes you. In autumn and winter you can enjoy mountain resorts of the Carpathians or the Alps or hot island paradises.<br /> <br /> <strong>Girls are very fond of when a man romantic.</strong><br />Sometimes a small gift fundamentally changes the relationship. Girls are in need of attention. Gift is a sign of attention. The girl is always smiling when she receives a pleasant present. A beautiful girl with a bunch of flowers you presented her with is radiating so much pleasant energy that even a picture taken of her at that moment will keep you warm if you put it on the desktop of your computer. Devote much attention to your girl-friend. If you can be generous and considerate, she will be loving and devoted.</p>',1,1443561912,'Tips and Advice',1462260952,8,0,NULL,266),(29,'Who we are','who-we-are','Who we are','Who we are','Who we are','<p>Our site was created for people,who want to find love.
